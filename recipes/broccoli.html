      This 3-cheese, saucy, Italian comfort food is loaded with broccoli and
      elevated with a bit of hot Italian sausage in the sauce—it's the perfect
      culinary combo! The manicotti shells are partially cooked in boiling
      water, and they finish cooking in the sauce while the entire dish is baked
      in the oven. Like many Italian dishes, this might even be better the next
      day! Enjoy hot or cold.

    <h2>Tips for Making a Great Cheese and Broccoli Stuffed Manicotti</h2>
    <p>
      Adding a vegetable to a cheesy, stuffed pasta filling is easy. The hard
      part is deciding how much. If you only add a hint, then what's the point?
      If we're not really going to taste it anyway, I'd rather just have a
      little more cheese. If we add too much, we're just eating vegetable
      stuffed pasta, which is not what we signed up for. That's why I enjoyed
      this three-cheese broccoli manicotti so much, since I thought it struck
      the perfect balance and was just right.
    </p>
    <p>
      One key tip here is to make sure your broccoli is very well drained after
      blanching. There will always be a little bit of water attached, but too
      much will dilute the flavor of your filling, and nobody wants diluted
      flavor. In the restaurant we'd actually use a salad spinner for larger
      batches, which isn't a bad idea, but letting your broccoli drain
      thoroughly in a colander is probably sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other big decision is how much sauce to bake your manicotti in. I like
      to completely cover the stuffed tubes, while others just spoon a little
      bit over the top, and then serve extra sauce on the side. You'll have to
      make that call, but if you do use the "wet" method, I recommend you thin
      the sauce out like I did in the video. And of course you can use whatever
      vegetables and cheese you want. But, no matter what you pipe or spoon
      inside, I really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!

      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <li>2 large heads broccoli</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package manicotti shells</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>4 ounces grated provolone cheese</li>
      <li>
        1 ½ cups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided, or more to taste
      </li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>3 ½ cups prepared marinara sauce</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>6 ounces cooked, crumbled, hot Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly chopped Italian parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <li>Bring a pot of generously salted water to a boil.</li>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, separate broccoli stems and florets. Cut florets in half and
        cut each stem into several pieces lengthwise.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <li>
        Place stems in the boiling water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Then add
        florets and cook until just barely tender, about 3 more minutes.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <li>
        Use a slotted spoon to transfer broccoli to a bowl of cold water,
        leaving the water boiling on the stove. Let broccoli sit until cool,
        about 2 minutes. Transfer to a colander and let sit until very well
        drained. Leave the bowl of cold water for the pasta.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add manicotti to the boiling water and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until tender but slightly undercooked, 6 to 7 minutes. Use
        a slotted spoon to gently transfer manicotti into the bowl of cold
        water.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <li>
        Chop cooled, drained broccoli into small pieces. Transfer 3 cups chopped
        broccoli to a mixing bowl and reserve any extra for another use.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <li>
        Add garlic, ricotta, provolone, 1 ¼ cups Parmigiano-Reggiano, eggs,
        salt, cayenne, pepper, and nutmeg to the broccoli. Mix with a spoon
        until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 8</h3>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <h3>Step 9</h3>
      <li>Bring tomato sauce and water to a simmer over medium-high heat.</li>
      <h3>Step 10</h3>
      <li>
        Ladle ½ inch hot sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish or lasagna pan.
        Sprinkle in cooked Italian sausage.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 11</h3>
      <li>
        Transfer broccoli filling into a pastry bag. Cut off the tip slightly
        smaller than the opening of the manicotti. Gently pipe stuffing into 12
        manicotti, being careful not to overstuff. Place stuffed manicotti in
        the sauce in the baking dish, angling as necessary to fit.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 12</h3>
      <li>
        Ladle in just enough sauce to barely cover the manicotti. Sprinkle ¼ cup
        Parmigiano-Reggiano over top.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 13</h3>
      <li>
        Bake in the center of the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 25 to 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 14</h3>
      <li>Garnish with parsley and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
      <h3>Step 15</h3>
      <li>
        Serve two manicotti per bowl, garnished with more Parmigiano-Reggiano.
      </li>
    </ul>
